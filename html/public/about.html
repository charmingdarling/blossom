<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Kim Nguyen. I am a new graduate of UC Berkeley Extension edX Coding
  Bootcamp.
</p>

<p>
  Right now, I am working on relearning the material that we went over in the
  last six months.
</p>

<p>
  I hope my hard work will pay off and I will be hired to work at a company that
  helps me wake up in the morning and gets me going.
