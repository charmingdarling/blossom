<h2>Japanese Light Novels</h2>
<p>
  These books are usually 300 pages long and are about another world from ours.
  The theme is often video-game related and skill building. It's very fluffy,
  but I love escaping to a safe place and able to predict the storyline.

<h2>Playing with My Dog - Momo</h2>
<p>
  My dog is 8 years-old and is an American Eskimo. She is a sweetheart and loves
  chasing after balls. I love her personality. She makes my day better and I
  cannot imagine the time I will have to say goodbye to such a good girl.

<h2>Dungeons and Dragon Podcast</h2>
<p>
  The last few years, I have been able to play Dungeons and Dragons only a
  handful of times. So the way I can get around this is by listening to the
  games that other people run. Now, I am enjoying a very full story of Critical
  Role's 3rd Campaign.
